# Phase 2 â€“ GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance)

## What is GRC?

GRC stands for Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance. It is a way for companies to manage cybersecurity in a structured and responsible way.

## 1. Governance

Governance refers to how an organization defines its **rules, responsibilities, and policies** for cybersecurity. In our e-commerce setup, governance would include:

- Assigning an admin to manage system updates and user roles
- Creating basic policies (password policy, backup policy, access control policy)
- Setting clear procedures in case of a security incident

Even a small business should have simple but clear policies written in Google Docs or shared with the team.

## 2. Risk Management

This is about **identifying, analyzing, and reducing** security risks.

In this internship, I performed:
- Asset identification (Step 1)
- Threat & vulnerability mapping (Step 2)
- Risk assessment matrix (Step 3)

To manage risk in a real environment, a business should:
- Regularly scan systems (e.g., using `nmap`, `ZAP`)
- Use secure configurations
- Keep backups and updates in place
- Review user accounts regularly

## 3. Compliance

Compliance means **following legal and regulatory rules** related to cybersecurity. In our case:

- We must protect customer data (DPDPA, GDPR)
- Use strong authentication and limit access (PCI-DSS)
- Understand Indian cyber laws (IT Act 2000)

Failing to follow these could result in:
- Data breaches
- Legal penalties
- Loss of customer trust

## Summary

Even though our e-commerce setup is small, applying GRC principles improves security, reduces risk, and helps stay legally compliant. It also prepares the organization for future growth by building a strong cybersecurity foundation.
