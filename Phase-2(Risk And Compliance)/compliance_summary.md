# Phase 2 – Compliance Requirements Summary

This document explains the key compliance standards and regulations that are relevant to our e-commerce system.

---

## 1. ISO 27001 – Information Security Management System (ISMS)

ISO 27001 is an international standard that helps organizations manage security risks. It focuses on identifying and minimizing threats to data, systems, and infrastructure. For our e-commerce site, it would mean keeping track of risks (as done in our risk matrix), using secure configurations, and documenting security policies.

## 2. GDPR – General Data Protection Regulation

GDPR is a European law that protects the personal data of people in the EU. If our e-commerce site serves European customers, we must ask permission before collecting data like email addresses or phone numbers. We must also allow users to request their data be deleted. Non-compliance can result in heavy penalties.

## 3. PCI-DSS – Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard

PCI-DSS is a set of security rules for handling credit card data. If our OpenCart store accepts payments via cards, we must ensure the data is encrypted, stored securely, and that access is limited. Even using third-party payment gateways (like Razorpay or Stripe) requires compliance.

## 4. DPDPA – Digital Personal Data Protection Act (India)

DPDPA is India’s new data protection law, similar to GDPR. It applies to any business collecting personal data of Indian citizens. It requires consent before collecting data and mandates data to be stored securely. This law is important for any Indian e-commerce company.

## 5. IT Act 2000 – Indian Cyber Law

The Information Technology Act, 2000 is the foundational cyber law in India. It deals with cybercrime, digital signatures, hacking, data protection, and legal responsibilities of businesses. For our setup, this means we must prevent unauthorized access, protect customer data, and take action against breaches.

## Summary

As part of securing the e-commerce platform, we must understand and respect these regulations to ensure data privacy, protect against cybercrime, and avoid legal penalties. These frameworks influence how we design security controls in later phases.
