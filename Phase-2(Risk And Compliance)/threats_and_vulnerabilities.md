## üí° Notes

- This threat modeling is based on a default installation of OpenCart on Apache, MySQL, and Ubuntu.
- Most of the vulnerabilities are preventable through basic security practices such as:
  - Keeping software updated
  - Enabling firewalls (like UFW or pfSense in Phase 4)
  - Enforcing strong passwords
  - Validating user input
